# Advanced Vault - Solana Anchor Program

A sophisticated token staking vault built on Solana using the Anchor framework. This program allows users to stake tokens for time-based rewards with different multiplier rates.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Token Staking**: Users can stake tokens for 1 or 2 years
- **Time-based Rewards**: Different multiplier rates based on staking duration
  - 1 year: 1x multiplier (no additional rewards)
  - 2 years: 2x multiplier (100% additional tokens)
- **Secure Withdrawal**: Tokens are locked until the staking period ends
- **Event Emission**: Comprehensive event logging for tracking stakes and withdrawals

### Program Structure
- **Vault Management**: Admin-controlled vault with PDA (Program Derived Address)
- **User Stakes**: Individual stake accounts for each user-vault combination
- **Token Integration**: Full SPL token support with associated token accounts

## üìã Instructions

### 1. Create Vault
```rust
create_vault(ctx: Context<CreateVault>) -> Result<()>
```
- Creates a new vault controlled by an admin
- Uses PDA with admin's public key as seed
- Only the admin can create the vault

### 2. Stake Tokens
```rust
stake_tokens(ctx: Context<StakeTokens>, amount: u64, stake_years: u8) -> Result<()>
```
- Allows users to stake tokens for 1 or 2 years
- Transfers tokens from user to vault
- Creates a user stake account with lock period
- Emits `StakeCreatedEvent`

### 3. Withdraw Stake
```rust
withdraw_stake(ctx: &mut Context<WithdrawStake>) -> Result<()>
```
- Allows users to withdraw their staked tokens after lock period
- Calculates total return based on multiplier
- Transfers tokens back to user
- Marks stake as withdrawn
- Emits `StakeWithdrawnEvent`

## üèóÔ∏è Account Structures

### Vault Account
```rust
pub struct Vault {
    pub admin: Pubkey,    // Vault administrator
    pub bump: u8,         // PDA bump seed
}
```

### UserStake Account
```rust
pub struct UserStake {
    pub user: Pubkey,         // User's public key
    pub amount: u64,          // Staked amount
    pub stake_years: u8,      // Staking duration (1 or 2 years)
    pub stake_time: i64,      // Timestamp when staked
    pub unlock_time: i64,     // Timestamp when tokens unlock
    pub is_withdrawn: bool,   // Withdrawal status
    pub bump: u8,            // PDA bump seed
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues & Limitations

### 1. **Limited Reward Structure**
- Only 1x and 2x multipliers available
- No intermediate reward rates (e.g., 1.5x for 18 months)
- No compound interest or dynamic rates

### 2. **Fixed Time Periods**
- Only supports 1 or 2 year staking periods
- No flexibility for shorter or longer periods
- No early withdrawal with penalties

### 3. **No Emergency Mechanisms**
- No admin ability to pause vault operations
- No emergency withdrawal functionality
- No circuit breaker for security issues

### 4. **Limited Vault Features**
- Single vault per admin (no multiple vaults)
- No vault configuration options
- No fee collection mechanism

### 5. **Security Considerations**
- No reentrancy protection explicitly implemented
- No maximum stake limits
- No minimum stake requirements

### 6. **Token Limitations**
- Only supports single token type per vault
- No multi-token vault support
- No token whitelist/blacklist functionality

## üîß Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70+
- Solana CLI
- Anchor CLI
- Node.js and Yarn

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd adv-vault

# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Build the program
anchor build

# Run tests
anchor test
```

### Configuration
The program is configured for localnet by default. Update `Anchor.toml` for different networks:

```toml
[provider]
cluster = "localnet"  # Change to devnet, mainnet-beta, etc.
wallet = "~/.config/solana/id.json"
```

## üß™ Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
anchor test
```

Current tests are minimal and need expansion to cover:
- Vault creation scenarios
- Token staking with different amounts and periods
- Withdrawal timing and validation
- Error conditions and edge cases
- Event emission verification

## üìä Usage Examples

### Creating a Vault
```typescript
const vault = await program.methods.createVault().accounts({
  admin: admin.publicKey,
  vault: vaultPda,
  systemProgram: SystemProgram.programId,
}).rpc();
```

### Staking Tokens
```typescript
const stake = await program.methods.stakeTokens(
  new BN(1000000), // 1 token (assuming 6 decimals)
  1 // 1 year stake
).accounts({
  vault: vaultPda,
  userStake: userStakePda,
  user: user.publicKey,
  userTokenAccount: userTokenAccount,
  vaultTokenAccount: vaultTokenAccount,
  mint: tokenMint,
  tokenProgram: TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
  associatedTokenProgram: ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
  systemProgram: SystemProgram.programId,
}).rpc();
```

### Withdrawing Stakes
```typescript
const withdraw = await program.methods.withdrawStake().accounts({
  vault: vaultPda,
  userStake: userStakePda,
  user: user.publicKey,
  userTokenAccount: userTokenAccount,
  vaultTokenAccount: vaultTokenAccount,
  mint: tokenMint,
  tokenProgram: TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
  associatedTokenProgram: ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
  systemProgram: SystemProgram.programId,
}).rpc();
```
